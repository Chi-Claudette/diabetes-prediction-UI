        <h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>
        <span>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. 
            The hormone insulin made by the pancreas helps glucose get into the  cells to be used for energy.
In the case of diabetes, the body doesnot make enough—or any—insulin, or doesnot use insulin properly, glucose then stays in the blood and doesnot reach the cells
This raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart.
